The files contained in this project have been created for a GCSE programming project.

To run any files you will need a python interpreter installed. https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-340/
Once you have a python interpreter installed you can run the project by through the executable in the root directory of the extracted folder or run:

    .\card_game\run.bat

If you cannot run the project in either of these ways, try running the python file through the python IDLE here:

    .\source\__main__.py

If you want to read my source code you can find the files at .\source\
