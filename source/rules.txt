There are 30 cards in the deck at the start of the game
Each card has:
    - a colour assigned to it (RED, BLACK or YELLOW)
    - a unique number
        - each colour has 10 cards
        - so there are 10 RED cards, 10 BLACK cards and 10 YELLOW cards
These cards are shuffled at the start of the game
Every turn each player takes a card from the top of the deck (PLayer 1 takes the top card first)
The two cards picked up are compared by:
    - comparing the colour of the two cards, if they are the same then:
        - the numbers are compared (the player with the higher number wins)
    - if they are different colours then they are compared with the table shown below:
         _____________________
        |Card	Card	Winner|
        |_____________________|
        |Red	Black	Red   |
        |Yellow	Red     Yellow|
        |Black	Yellow	Black |
        |_____________________|
